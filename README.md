I'm Seun.
I currently am a Quality Assurance Software Tester, I am very good with manual testing.

I currently work for is a small team I took on different responsibilities at different times, I am currently holding the responsibility of the head of the testing team(even though I started out as just a research person), and I am responsible for managing a team of 3 members and ensuring that the abilities of my team members are efficiently utilised by assigning tasks and ensuring they are delivered. I draw up test plans, create test cases, and conduct User-Acceptance-Test, UI, API, Integration testing etc.

My responsibility is to ensure that what the software develops is in line with the business requirement specifications and meets User Acceptance.

I also take on the responsibility of documenting software and business requirement specifications and I design UI mock-ups for applications. I have always taken on different and multiple responsibilities as the need arises so you can be rest assured that I am a hard-working and resourceful person, and I am willing to learn on the job where my skill might be lacking, I am a fast learner.

I like to be in a challenging work environment where I can learn and fully utilize my training and skills, while making a significant contribution to the success of the organisation

I am an aspiring programmer and Product Manager, sometime in the future I would like create new product solution, coordinate and drive the production of the product to meet the user needs.
