I'm Seun.

Background writing and implementing test cases, developing testing plans and identifying use cases. Fully versed in complete SDLC. Effective team player offering exceptional analytical and critical thinking skills and the important ability to function well in a fast-paced business environment.

Throughout the course of my career, I have perfected my communication and problem-solving abilities. I am a capable and consistent problem-solver skilled at prioritizing and managing projects with proficiency.

In my current role, I contributed to the Integration testing, System testing, and User Acceptance testing of the Applications Under Test.

I have proven to effectively collaborate with different stakeholders in creating an effective test plan and carrying out Mobile, Web and API testing. I enjoy collective brainstorming sessions which allow me to understand the problem at hand, contribute to providing business solutions and better coordinate testing activities to achieve a common goal.


I am currently the head of the testing team in my company, and I am responsible for managing a team of 3 members and ensuring that the abilities of my team members are efficiently utilised by assigning tasks and ensuring they are delivered. I draw up test plans, create test cases, and conduct User-Acceptance-Test, UI, API, Integration testing etc.

My responsibility is to ensure that what the software develops is in line with the business requirement specifications and meets User Acceptance.

I also take on the responsibility of documenting software and business requirement specifications and I design UI mock-ups for applications. I have always taken on different and multiple responsibilities as the need arises so you can be rest assured that I am a hard-working and resourceful person, and I am willing to learn on the job where my skill might be lacking, I am a fast learner.
